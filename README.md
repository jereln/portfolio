[Deployed app](http://www.jerelnavarrete.com)

##Description
A simple Rails app that allows employers see my awesome Rails skills.

##Approach
###Chapter 3
The assignments seem to be getting easier as I begin to grasp the concepts. I feel more comfortable writing tests. My struggle with the tests on this assignment was getting used to the DSL. I still get confused between Capybara and Rspec. I was able to find a Capybara guide that helped me be able to click on the first "destroy" link.  

###Chapter 4  
I deployed my app to Heroku and had my custom domain direct to the app. The biggest struggle was getting  Foundations 5 to work with my app. After 2 hours of trying to figure out the problem, it turns out all I needed to do was use an older version of the gem. I also set up an AWS account, but I'm not sure what it is or why I need it. Lastly, I spent a lot of time trying to get my app to look nice. This is difficult because I want things to look nice but and a beginner at HTML/CSS. There was an issue with the asset pipeline that Ivan helped me figure out. Also, it is difficult trying to figure out where all the CSS styles are housed.
