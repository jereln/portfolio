#Portfolio

[Deployed app](http://www.jerelnavarrete.com)

##Description
A simple Rails app that allows employers see my awesome Rails skills.

##Approach
###Chapter 3
The assignments seem to be getting easier as I begin to grasp the concepts. I feel more comfortable writing tests. My struggle with the tests on this assignment was getting used to the DSL. I still get confused between Capybara and Rspec. I was able to find a Capybara guide that helped me be able to click on the first "destroy" link.  

###Chapter 4  
I deployed my app to Heroku and had my custom domain direct to the app. The biggest struggle was getting  Foundations 5 to work with my app. After 2 hours of trying to figure out the problem, it turns out all I needed to do was use an older version of the gem. I also set up an AWS account, but I'm not sure what it is or why I need it. Lastly, I spent a lot of time trying to get my app to look nice. This is difficult because I want things to look nice but and a beginner at HTML/CSS. There was an issue with the asset pipeline that Ivan helped me figure out. Also, it is difficult trying to figure out where all the CSS styles are housed.

###Chapter 5
It is definitely getting easier and easier as we go on. BDD is coming more naturally to me. It was great to go step by step and resolve the errors. Most of the problems that I ran into was due to a spelling/typing mistake.

##Chapter 6
It took me about 3-4 hours to complete this assignment. This biggest pain points for me were some migration error that mostly were due to spelling errors or migrating a column into the wrong table. I still have one extra column in a table that I need to delete. The RailsCast episodes on user authentication were very helpful. When creating tests, it can sometimes be hard to know that steps I need to go through to get to where I want (e.g., what feilds there will be and what messages to expect).

##Chatper 8
The documentation for Pundit was fairly thorough. There were a few things that I was missing at first that I noticed after reading the docs more in depth. I had a problem using a subclass in the article policy so I ended up using a struct. The biggest problem I had was my fixtures not loading properly and the user ID not matching the author ID. I ended up manually setting up the ID in the fixture.
