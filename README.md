#Portfolio

##Description
A simple Rails app that allows employers see my awesome Rails skills.

##Approach
The assignments seem to be getting easier as I begin to grasp the concepts. I feel more comfortable writing tests. My struggle with the tests on this assignment was getting used to the DSL. I still get confused between Capybara and Rspec. I was able to find a Capybara guide that helped me be able to click on the first "destroy" link.
